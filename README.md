Nuwk
====

Nuwk! makes it easy to create Mac Applications based on node-webkit, simplifying testing and building procedures. It takes care of creating the executable, attaching the app icon and configuring the plist file accordingly.

###Very alpha stage
At the moment Nuwk! is very alpha. The code is written poorly (Unfortunately I have very little free time), however I believe it can be an interesting tool for those who have just begun to develop on node-webkit. So if you're going to use it in production do so at your own risk.
